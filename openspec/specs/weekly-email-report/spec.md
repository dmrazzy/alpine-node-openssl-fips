# weekly-email-report Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change nightly-beats-cve-scan. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Trigger Gating
The email and cve-reports branch commit steps SHALL only execute when triggered
by schedule, or when the repository variable BEATS_CVE_TEST_EMAIL is set (test
mode). workflow_dispatch and push triggers SHALL skip these steps unless
BEATS_CVE_TEST_EMAIL is set.

#### Scenario: Schedule trigger
- **WHEN** the workflow is triggered by schedule
- **THEN** the email step executes and sends to production recipients

#### Scenario: workflow_dispatch without test email
- **WHEN** the workflow is triggered by workflow_dispatch and BEATS_CVE_TEST_EMAIL is not set
- **THEN** the email and branch-commit steps are skipped without error

#### Scenario: Test mode
- **WHEN** BEATS_CVE_TEST_EMAIL is set on any trigger
- **THEN** the email step executes and sends to the address in BEATS_CVE_TEST_EMAIL

### Requirement: CVE Diff
The workflow SHALL diff the current report against the most recent dated
baseline on the cve-reports branch. A full_report dispatch input SHALL bypass
the diff and include all CVEs in the email.

#### Scenario: Baseline exists
- **WHEN** a previous dated report exists on the cve-reports branch
- **THEN** only CVE IDs present in the current report but absent from the baseline appear in the email table

#### Scenario: No baseline
- **WHEN** no previous report exists on the cve-reports branch
- **THEN** all CVE IDs in the current report are treated as new

#### Scenario: full_report flag
- **WHEN** the workflow is triggered by workflow_dispatch with full_report=true
- **THEN** the baseline is ignored and all current CVEs appear in the email table

#### Scenario: No new CVEs
- **WHEN** the diff produces zero new CVEs
- **THEN** the email body states that no new CVEs were found (no empty table is shown)

### Requirement: Email Content
The email SHALL be an HTML message sent to security@elastic.co and
support@elastic.co with CC to kboone@ainq.com, containing the beats version,
deployment ID, and an HTML table of new CVEs sorted by CVSS score descending,
with full JSON and CSV attachments.

#### Scenario: Recipients
- **WHEN** the production email is sent
- **THEN** it is addressed To security@elastic.co and support@elastic.co with CC kboone@ainq.com

#### Scenario: Subject
- **WHEN** the email is sent
- **THEN** the subject includes "Beats CVE Report" and the current date

#### Scenario: HTML table
- **WHEN** the email is sent and new CVEs exist
- **THEN** the HTML body contains: beats version, deployment ID 96949b9e33264bbba8e8934a7c7984de, and a table of new CVEs sorted by CVSS Score descending with columns CVE ID, Severity, CVSS Score, CVE Created Date, Installed Version, Fixed In, File Path, Package Name, Description

#### Scenario: Attachments
- **WHEN** the email is sent
- **THEN** the full filtered JSON and CSV files are present as attachments

### Requirement: Beats Version Detection
The beats version SHALL be captured by running the built image locally in the
build job and passed as a job output to the CVE report job.

#### Scenario: Version capture
- **WHEN** the image is built with --load
- **THEN** docker run /usr/bin/filebeat version succeeds and the version string is set as a job output consumed by the beats-cve-report job
