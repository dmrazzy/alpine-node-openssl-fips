# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo produces

A single Docker image — `alpine-node-openssl-fips` — bundling Alpine 3.23, Node 24
(Alpine's dynamically-linked build), a from-source build of OpenSSL 3.5.x configured
with the FIPS provider, and Elastic filebeat/metricbeat binaries. The image is the
base layer for FISMA-moderate IZ Gateway services that require a FIPS encryption module.

There is **no application code** here. The repo is the `Dockerfile`, GitHub Actions
workflows that build/scan/publish the image, and OpenSpec specs documenting those
workflows. There are no unit tests, linters, or `package.json` — the "test" is that
`docker build` succeeds and `openssl list -providers` shows the FIPS provider loaded.

## Build & verify

```bash
# Local build — resolves latest OpenSSL 3.5.x + latest Beats from upstream APIs at build time
docker build -t alpine-node-openssl-fips:dev .

# Pin versions (CI passes these; the Dockerfile falls back to API lookup when unset)
docker build \
  --build-arg OPENSSL_VERSION=3.5.6 \
  --build-arg BEATS_VERSION_OVERRIDE=9.3.2 \
  -t alpine-node-openssl-fips:dev .

# Confirm the FIPS provider is active inside the image
docker run --rm alpine-node-openssl-fips:dev openssl list -providers
```

Version numbers in commits/PRs should generally not be hard-coded: the canonical
version is whatever the upstream APIs return at build time. The fallback constants in
the Dockerfile (`3.5.6`, `9.3.2`) exist only for API outages, not as canonical pins.

## Image architecture (`Dockerfile`)

Two-stage build. Understanding the FIPS wiring requires reading both stages plus
`openssl_fips_insert.txt` together:

1. **Stage 1 `openssl-build`** — Alpine + build deps. Downloads the OpenSSL 3.5.x source
   tarball from GitHub Releases (version from `OPENSSL_VERSION` arg or GitHub API),
   runs `./Configure enable-fips && make && make install`, copies `fips.so` into
   `/usr/lib/ossl-modules/`, generates `fipsmodule.cnf` via `openssl fipsinstall`, then
   uses an `awk` splice to replace the default commented-out `# fips = fips_sect` block
   in `/usr/local/ssl/openssl.cnf` with the active provider block from
   `openssl_fips_insert.txt`. The original config is preserved as `openssl.cnf.dist`.
2. **Stage 2** — Fresh Alpine. Installs `nodejs npm` plus operational packages
   (`nginx`, `dnsmasq`, `bind-tools`, `logrotate`, `curl`, `ca-certificates`, etc., some
   with version pins for CVE patches), copies `/usr/local` and `fips.so` from stage 1,
   then downloads filebeat + metricbeat tarballs. SNAPSHOT versions come from
   `snapshots.elastic.co`; released versions from `artifacts.elastic.co`.

**Key invariant:** both stages set `OPENSSL_FIPS=1` and
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64:/usr/lib/ossl-modules` so the OS
`openssl` CLI and the dynamically-linked `node` load the FIPS-enabled OpenSSL built in
stage 1, not Alpine's system OpenSSL. `openssl_fips_insert.txt` is the FIPS-only provider
config — editing it changes which providers the image loads by default.

## CI architecture (`.github/workflows/`)

All three workflows target AWS ECR + ghcr.io:

- **`build.yml`** — Production pipeline. Triggers: weekly Mon 10:00 UTC, push to main,
  PRs to main, manual dispatch. Two jobs:
  - `build` — resolves component versions (Alpine digest, latest OpenSSL 3.5.x, latest
    Beats release), builds with buildx local cache (`.buildx-cache/`), pushes to
    `ghcr.io/izgateway/alpine-node-openssl-fips:latest` and ECR `:<run-number>` + `:latest`.
    Captures the installed Beats version by running `filebeat version` against the build.
  - `beats-cve-report` — skipped on PRs (no ECR push to scan). Polls ECR Enhanced Scan
    until ACTIVE, pulls findings, filters to `filebeat|metricbeat` packages via jq,
    generates JSON+CSV, diffs against the most recent dated report on the `cve-reports`
    branch, emails Elastic security on scheduled runs, commits the report to `cve-reports`.
- **`build-snapshot.yml`** — Same shape as `build.yml` but Mon 08:00 UTC (intentionally
  *before* the release build), targeting upcoming Beats SNAPSHOT versions. Builds into ECR
  repo `alpine-node-openssl-fips-snapshot` tagged `future-beats` (never `:latest`). Reports
  go to the `cve-reports-snapshot` branch (auto-created on first run).
- **`build-snapshot-placeholder.yml`** — Empty stub on `main`; keeps GitHub's UI happy.

### CVE pipeline scripts (`.github/scripts/`)

- `inspector-report.jq` — converts ECR enhanced-findings JSON to CSV rows. `--arg paths`
  is the filePath regex filter; `--arg cutoff` is a date filter (empty = no filter).
- `beats-cve-diff.sh` — prints CVE IDs in `current.json` absent from `baseline.json`
  (all current IDs if baseline is missing).
- `beats-cve-email.sh` — builds the HTML email body. Optional 6th positional arg is the
  label suffix the snapshot workflow passes ("SNAPSHOT").

### Trigger gating to remember

The email + cve-reports commit steps in `build.yml` run only when
`github.event_name == 'schedule'` **or** the repo variable `BEATS_CVE_TEST_EMAIL` is set.
Set that variable to your own address to dry-run the email path on a manual dispatch, then
unset it. Without it, `workflow_dispatch` runs build + scan + artifact upload but skips
email and the branch commit. The `full_report` dispatch input bypasses the baseline diff
and includes every current CVE.

### Reports branch convention

`cve-reports` (release) and `cve-reports-snapshot` (snapshot) are **orphan** branches
holding only `reports/*.json` and `reports/*.csv`. Scheduled runs write
`beats-cve-YYYY-MM-DD.json`; manual dispatches append `-run-N` to avoid same-day
collisions. `beats-cve-latest.json/csv` is overwritten every run and is the diff fallback
when no dated baseline exists. Dated files are immutable; only `*-latest.*` is overwritten.
Every commit to these branches includes `[skip ci]`.

## OpenSpec workflow

This repo uses [OpenSpec](https://github.com/openspec-dev/openspec) (the `openspec` CLI)
for spec-driven changes to CI/CD behavior. Specs live in `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`,
in-flight changes in `openspec/changes/<name>/`, archived under `openspec/changes/archive/`.
Three capabilities — `daily-cve-scan`, `weekly-email-report`, `cve-reports-branch` —
document the CVE pipeline the workflows implement.

The `.github/skills/openspec-*/` directories are Claude Code skills driving the workflow,
exposed as `/opsx:new`, `/opsx:apply`, `/opsx:verify`, `/opsx:archive`, etc. (prompt
versions in `.github/prompts/opsx-*.prompt.md`). Use these rather than hand-editing
OpenSpec files when working on a change.
